# Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to Programming Fundamentals!

This is where you’ll discover the core skills and foundations that will let you talk to computers in their own language. Just like you talk to a friend. But here’s the twist: computers don’t understand English, Spanish, or Arabic. They only understand special instructions called code.

To give you an idea,
Basically we can give a computer a simple command like

```language
-> Make a round button
-> Place it on the left of the screen!
-> Color it Red
```

That’s all a programming really is — a list of instructions.


This Series covers the basic concepts that are essential for any programmer, its like learning the essential knowledge of driving regardless the make of the car. 

## You’ll learn things like:

- What a program really means.
- How computers “think” and follow instructions.
- The basic building blocks of code (variables, loops, logic, and more).
- How to put it all together to create something fun and practical.
