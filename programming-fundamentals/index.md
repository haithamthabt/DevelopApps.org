# Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to Programming Fundamentals!

This is where you’ll discover your new superpower: the ability to understand and talk to computers.
Just like chatting with a friend — but here’s the catch: computers don’t understand English, Spanish, or Arabic. They only understand their own special language made of 0s and 1s.

In this series, you’ll learn the core skills and foundations that let you communicate with this language. Once you understand it and can give clear commands, you’ll officially be called a programmer (or coder).

To give you an idea,
Basically we can give a computer a simple command like

```language
-> Make a round button
-> Place it on the left of the screen!
-> Color it Red
```

That’s all a programming really is — a list of instructions.


We will cover the basic concepts that are essential for any programmer, its like learning the essential knowledge of driving regardless the make of the car. 

## You’ll learn things like:

- What a program really means.
- How computers “think” and follow instructions.
- The basic building blocks of code (variables, loops, logic, and more).
- How to put it all together to create something fun and practical.
