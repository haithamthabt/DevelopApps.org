# ASP.NET MVC

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components:

## Core Components

### Model
- Represents data and business logic
- Handles data validation
- Manages application state

### View
- Displays the user interface
- Uses Razor syntax for dynamic content
- Handles layout and templating

### Controller
- Processes incoming requests
- Handles user input
- Coordinates model and view

## Key Features
